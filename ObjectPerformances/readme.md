## Background information

Talk about definition of efficiency and turn on here

Talk about what each folder is doing


## Compiling the code

First we need to set up root and fastjet.  If you do `root-config` and `fastjet-config` and both are found, you are ready to go.

Then we set an environment variable

```
export ProjectBase=`pwd`
```

(or `csh` equivalent)

Then...simply type

```
make
```

to compile everything.

One can clean things up by doing

```
make CleanAll
```
